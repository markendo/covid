## Vision
A tiny virus has brought society to a halt, while teaching us that we need to forget about fame and fortune and instead unite as a species globally!

Our vision is to develop a smartphone app that can be used by everyone in the world to find out in minutes whether they have COVID-19. We are utilizing cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology to identify patterns undetectable by humans from the unique respiratory signatures of lungs damaged by the virus. From extensive research, we believe we can achieve 90% or more accuracy and bring an end to this pandemic!

## Open Dataset
Our data can be found in the [data/ folder](./data).

The data set is split into two different folders, one containing the original cough audio recordings, and the other containing the segmented versions of the coughs.
The segmented coughs were created by indintifying periods of relative silence in the recordings and seperating coughs based on those silences. The segments which were not coughs or had too much background noise are removed.
